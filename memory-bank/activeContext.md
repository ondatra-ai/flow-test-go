# Active Context

## Current Task
- **E2E Subprocess Tests Implementation** (Level 3 - Intermediate Feature)
- **GitHub Issue**: #5 - https://github.com/ondatra-ai/flow-test-go/issues/5
- **Branch**: task-20250109-e2e-subprocess-tests
- **Status**: Planning phase COMPLETE, requires CREATIVE mode for design decisions

## Task Overview
Implementing comprehensive end-to-end tests with:
- Subprocess execution of built application
- Test isolation with temporary directories
- Coverage collection from subprocess
- Coverage aggregation and reporting
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline

## Planning Summary
✅ **Requirements Analysis**: Complete - all technical requirements documented
✅ **Component Analysis**: Identified Makefile, tests/e2e/**, CI workflow changes
✅ **Technology Validation**: POC successful - GOCOVERDIR coverage collection verified
✅ **Implementation Strategy**: 4-phase approach defined with clear milestones
✅ **Design Decisions**: Identified need for test framework architecture

## Key Technology Validation Results
- Go 1.24.5 supports GOCOVERDIR coverage mode
- Successfully built binary with -cover flag
- Collected coverage data using GOCOVERDIR environment variable
- Converted and generated coverage reports with go tool covdata

## Creative Phases Required
1. **Test Framework Architecture Design** - Design reusable subprocess testing utilities
2. **Coverage Collection Strategy Design** - Design coverage aggregation workflow
3. **CI/CD Integration Architecture** - Design GitHub Actions integration

## Next Step Required
This Level 3 task has identified creative design decisions needed before implementation.

Type 'CREATIVE' to begin the creative design phase.
