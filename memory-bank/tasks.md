# Task: Implement End-to-End Tests with Subprocess Execution and Coverage Collection

## Description
Need to implement comprehensive end-to-end (e2e) tests that run the built flow-test-go application as a subprocess with proper test isolation and coverage collection.

## GitHub Issue
Issue #5: https://github.com/ondatra-ai/flow-test-go/issues/5

## Complexity
Level: 3
Type: Intermediate Feature

## Technology Stack
- Language: Go 1.21+
- Testing Framework: Go standard testing package + testify
- Coverage Tool: Go 1.20+ coverage with GOCOVERDIR support
- Build Tool: Make
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Technology Validation Checkpoints

### Technology Validation Results (POC Completed)
- ✅ Go version 1.24.5 supports GOCOVERDIR
- ✅ Built binary with -cover flag successfully
- ✅ GOCOVERDIR collected coverage data (covcounters and covmeta files)
- ✅ Converted coverage data to standard format with go tool covdata
- ✅ Generated coverage report showing 50% coverage for POC
- [x] Go 1.20+ available (required for GOCOVERDIR coverage mode)
- [x] Build with -cover flag produces instrumented binary
- [x] GOCOVERDIR environment variable collects coverage data
- [x] go tool covdata can merge coverage files
- [x] Subprocess execution with os/exec package works

## Key Results
1. **E2E Test Infrastructure**: Create robust subprocess testing framework that runs the built application binary
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in dedicated temporary directory with complete isolation between tests
3. **Coverage Collection**: Successfully collect coverage data from subprocess execution using -cover build flags
4. **Coverage Aggregation**: Combine coverage from all e2e tests into single comprehensive report
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflow
6. **Test Reliability**: All e2e tests pass consistently without flakiness
7. **Documentation**: Clear documentation for writing and maintaining e2e tests
