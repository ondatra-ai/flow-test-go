# E2E Testing Design Decisions Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the key design decisions made during the creative phase for implementing e2e tests with subprocess execution and coverage collection.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Test Framework Architecture
**Decision**: Builder Pattern Framework with Fluent API
- Provides type-safe, readable test construction
- Supports method chaining for configuration
- Includes sensible defaults for common scenarios
- Example: `NewE2ETest(t).WithBinary("bin/app").WithArgs("--help").Run()`

### 2. Coverage Collection Strategy
**Decision**: Hierarchical Coverage Structure
- Organized by package/test for easy navigation
- Directory structure: `coverage/e2e/{package}/{test_name}/`
- Includes manifest.json for tracking test metadata
- Supports incremental and filtered aggregation

### 3. CI/CD Integration
**Decision**: Parallel Job Execution
- E2E tests run in parallel with unit tests and linting
- Reduces overall CI time while maintaining coverage
- Includes retry mechanism for flaky tests
- Uploads coverage artifacts and comments on PRs

## Implementation Guidelines

### Package Structure
```
tests/e2e/
├── testutil/           # Shared testing utilities
│   ├── builder.go      # E2ETestBuilder
│   ├── command.go      # Command execution
│   ├── coverage.go     # Coverage collection
│   └── options.go      # Configuration options
├── command_test.go     # CLI command tests
├── flow_test.go        # Flow operation tests
├── mcp_test.go         # MCP integration tests
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

### Key Interfaces
- **E2ETestBuilder**: Main test construction interface
- **TestCommand**: Subprocess execution wrapper
- **CoverageCollector**: Coverage data management

### Next Steps
1. Implement testutil package with core components
2. Create initial test cases for basic commands
3. Set up Makefile targets
4. Update CI workflow
5. Document usage patterns

## Verification
All design decisions align with:
- ✅ Go 1.20+ GOCOVERDIR support
- ✅ Existing project patterns
- ✅ CI/CD best practices
- ✅ Test maintainability goals
