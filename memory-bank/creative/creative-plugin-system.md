# 🎨🎨🎨 ARCHIVED: AI Provider Plugin System 🎨🎨🎨

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This document describes a plugin system for AI providers that was **REPLACED** by OpenRouter integration.
> 
> **Current Decision**: Use OpenRouter (github.com/reVrost/go-openrouter) as a unified LLM facade
> 
> **See**: `creative-openrouter-integration.md` for the current approach

## Original Design (For Historical Reference)

This document originally explored three options for AI provider integration:
1. Simple Interface Pattern
2. Factory Pattern with Registry  
3. Full Plugin Architecture with Capabilities (was selected)

The Full Plugin Architecture was chosen for its flexibility and production readiness.

## Why This Was Replaced

After the initial design phase, we decided to use OpenRouter, which provides:
- Single API for 200+ models from all major providers
- No need to implement individual provider integrations
- Automatic failover between providers
- Unified billing and usage tracking
- Future-proof as new models are automatically available

## Current Architecture

Instead of building a plugin system, we now:
1. Use OpenRouter as the single LLM provider interface
2. Configure model selection through OpenRouter's API
3. Let OpenRouter handle provider-specific details
4. Focus on integrating OpenRouter with LangGraph

For the current implementation approach, see:

- `examples/langgraph-integration/openrouter-langgraph.go`
