## Completed Milestones
- **Test Coverage Enhancement** completed on 2025-01-04. Successfully improved coverage from 66.3% to 89.5% (exceeding 85% target). See [archive entry](archive/archive-test-coverage-improvement-20250104.md).
- **E2E Subprocess Testing Framework** completed on 2025-01-10. Successfully implemented comprehensive end-to-end testing with subprocess execution, coverage collection, security fixes, and code quality improvements. Eliminated ~210 lines of code duplication. See [archive entry](archive/archive-e2e-subprocess-tests-20250110.md).

- âœ… Created comprehensive documentation and reflection materials
## Implementation Summary - 2025-08-01 09:37:25

### âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
- [x] Directory structure created (testdata/flows/basic, testdata/flows/error-cases, testutil)
- [x] Placeholder test removed
- [x] Build environment prepared

**Phase 2: Core E2E Tests**
- [x] Test flow files created:
  - single-step.json (basic single prompt flow)
  - multi-step.json (sequential steps)
  - with-conditions.json (conditional branching)
  - Error cases: invalid-json.json, missing-initial.json, invalid-step-ref.json, circular-ref.json
- [x] Test utilities package implemented:
  - builder.go (4.4KB) - FlowTestBuilder with fluent API
  - runner.go (4.6KB) - Subprocess execution with coverage
  - coverage.go (8.9KB) - Coverage collection and aggregation
- [x] Test files created:
  - flow_basic_test.go (3.7KB) - 4 basic flow tests
  - flow_conditional_test.go (4.0KB) - 4 conditional flow tests
  - flow_error_test.go (6.1KB) - 5 error handling tests
- [x] Makefile updated with e2e targets

**Phase 3: Coverage Integration**
- [x] GOCOVERDIR-based coverage collection
- [x] Coverage aggregation with go tool covdata
- [x] HTML and text report generation
- [x] Coverage manifest tracking

**Phase 4: Documentation**
- [x] Comprehensive README.md (7.3KB) created
- [x] API documentation with examples
- [x] Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Usage instructions

### ðŸ“Š Implementation Metrics
- **Total Files Created**: 11 files
- **Test Files**: 3 test files with 13 total test functions
- **Test Data**: 7 JSON flow files (3 valid, 4 error cases)
- **Documentation**: Complete README with examples
- **Build Targets**: 4 new Makefile targets

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented
1. **Subprocess Testing**: Tests run flow-test-go as subprocess with coverage
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in isolated temp directory
3. **Coverage Collection**: GOCOVERDIR-based coverage from subprocess
4. **Fluent API**: Builder pattern for readable test construction
5. **Error Testing**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
6. **Parallel Execution**: Tests can run in parallel safely
7. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full usage and troubleshooting guide

### ðŸ§ª Test Coverage Areas
- Basic flow execution (single-step, multi-step)
- Conditional flow branching
- Error handling (JSON errors, validation errors, missing files)
- Timeout handling
- Performance testing
- File not found scenarios

**STATUS: Ready for testing and integration** âœ…

## 2025-01-11: GitHub Actions Comment Monitoring Workflow Added
- **Issue**: #8 - Add GitHub Actions workflow for PR/Issue comment monitoring
- **Complexity**: Level 1 (Quick Feature Addition)
- **Files Created**:
  - /.github/workflows/comment-monitor.yml: Verified and committed
- **Key Implementation**:
  - Event trigger: issue_comment with types [created]
  - Single job with minimal ubuntu-latest setup
  - Outputs: comment author, body, PR/Issue number, repository, timestamp
  - Follows existing CI patterns with minimal permissions
- **Validation**: Pre-commit hooks passed including workflow validation
- **Status**: Complete and ready for testing with real comments
- **Next Steps**: Create PR for review and testing
